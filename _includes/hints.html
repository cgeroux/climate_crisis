      <h1 class="title">Why aren't Governments moving faster on the climate crisis?</h1>
      
      <p class="has-text-justified">These podcasts and youtube channels have really helped me understand why our governments aren't moving faster on the climate crisis. <i>Drilled</i> is especially detailed and focused on answering this particular question, while the others talk more broadly on the climate crisis in general. All of these sources, however are consistent when they talk about this question.<br/><br/>

      I highly recommend you check out these great podcasts and youtube channels, however, if you are pressed for time, as so many are, here is the long and short of it.<br/><br/>

      The oil and gas, and to some extent the automotive industry have had massive public relations and marketing ad campaigns to completely shape our cultural understanding and feelings towards their products for many decades. They also put a lot of money into lobbying our governments to minimize the regulations of their industries. Ok, so you might wonder, is that very different from other industries promoting their products which we, largely deem as acceptable? Well, did those other industries willingly misinform the public about the dangers of their product for decades? Would those other products have such detrimental effects to all life on Earth? OK, well, maybe they didn't know, maybe they were just doing what all the other industries do to make money? Unfortunately no, they knew about climate change. In fact, they employed scientists that were doing cutting edge research on the topic in the 1970s. See for example <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/01/harvard-led-analysis-finds-exxonmobil-internal-research-accurately-predicted-climate-change/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhat%20we%20found%20is%20that,denying%20that%20very%20climate%20science.%E2%80%9D">this article from The Harvard Gazzette</a>. However, you can just google it and find lots of similar articles (e.g. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/">Scientific American</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/12/exxon-climate-change-global-warming-research">The Guardian</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-64241994">BBC</a> etc.). So, now we have large groups of the public, and the government representing them, fairly misinformed about our situation. Combine that with many having investments in fossil fuels makes winding down the fossil fuel industry very difficult and slow in our democratic systems that require broad public support to make change.

      <p class="has-text-justified">On the related issue, the biodiversity crisis, I have also been listening to the Future Ecologies podcast. It has given me more perspective on our natural world and how we interact with it. Of particular relevance to the climate crisis, they talk fairly extensively about forest fires. I encourage people to check it out.<br/><br/></p>
