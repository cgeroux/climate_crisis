          It can be very difficult to know how or what you can do to make meaningful change to adress the climate crisis. I have been thinking and searching for ways I can make a difference and I am still searching. One meaningful way to take action is to <b>talk about the climate crisis</b>. Extending the idea of talking about the climate crisis, I have decided to <b>put up posters</b> to help encourage that conversation more broadly. My hope is that posters will make the issue more visible in the real world and encourage people to talk about it, reducing the taboo around the topic. There are many ways to take action and I have found that finding ways that fit into my everyday life helped me take at least some small actions. The <b>David Suzuki foundation</b> has a <a href="https://davidsuzuki.org/what-you-can-do/transform-your-climate-concern-into-climate-action/">list of ways you can take action</a> and information about how to <a href="https://davidsuzuki.org/climate-conversation-coach/">have climate conversations</a> which aren't always easy.
