          Before I mention what helped me understand a bit of why Government (and all of us really) aren't moving faster on the climate crisis lets address a related question, why do we need to move faster on the climate crisis?<br/><br/>

          After a recent conversation with a friend I realized, that not everyone is asking, "why aren't governments moving faster?". I started this page and posters because I wanted to help people like me who were struggling to understand this question. However, to be more general because not everyone is like me, lets talk a little about why we need to move faster on the climate crisis.<br/><br/>

          For a long time I didn't understand how urgent the situation is, I am still learning everyday new reasons for more urgent action. However, a big turning point for me, was sometime between the end of 2018 and 2019, when my Dad told me about the then recent special report by the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">IPCC</a>, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/">"Global Warming of 1.5 C"</a>. Feel free to read it, but there is lots in there, the main point that I think is critical to understanding the scale of change needed and the urgency can be read from the Summary For Policymakers document.

<figure style="padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em;"><blockquote style="margin:0px;"><p style="padding:15px;background:#eee;border-radius:5px;">In model pathways with no or limited overshoot of 1.5°C, global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 (40–60% interquartile range), reaching net zero around 2050 (2045–2055 interquartile range).</p></blockquote><figcaption>— ipcc: <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/">Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5C, Summary for Policymakers</a>, from the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/spm-c/">Emissions Pathways and System Transitions Consistent with 1.5 C Global Warming</a></figcaption>chapter.</figure>

        That means, <b>we need to nearly half (or more) our emissions globally by 2030</b>. As of this writing this that is in 7 years from now.<br/><br/>

        Ok, so how important is it to stay within 1.5C? The main reason is that above 1.5C (and even before in some cases) our natural systems, forests, oceans, ice, that are helping mitigate the climate crisis will start to drive it. Making it increasingly difficult to stop run away warming. I very recently also learned that <b>Canadian forests haven't been helping us reduce our CO2 emissions for quite some time and are actually driving CO2 levels up</b> (think forest fires). See for example this <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/canada-forests-carbon-sink-or-source-1.5011490">CBC article from 2019</a>. At something like 1 - 1.1 C of warming we are already seeing this flip from natural systems that help, to those that drive the climate crisis.<br/><br/>

        Ok, but are our global governments already handling things, are we already on our way to those large reductions of emissions we need? Especially in <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/canada/">Canada</a> and the <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/usa/">US</a> our governments are not. In Europe, they are making more progress (see <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/eu/">Climate Action Tracker - EU</a>), but still not enough. If you look at the relatively new large emitters like <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china/">China</a> who haven't contributed the bulk of the current atmospheric CO2, their emissions are growing rapidly. We are no where near on track, and we only have <b>7 years</b> to get there!<br/><br/>

        At this point, though you might still be digesting some of that information if it is new to you, you are probably getting an idea of the scale and urgency needed. However, one final point I would like to make, specifically with regard to Canada, since that is where I live, is how the largest contributors of our emissions have changed over the last 30 years. <b>Emissions from electricity generation has decreased by about 45%</b> (a significant contributor in 1990), <b>while those from transportation and the oil & gas sector have increased to nearly completely offset those reductions</b> (see the Canadian Government's own <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/greenhouse-gas-emissions.html#wb-auto-6">environment and climate change page</a> on the "Economic sectors" tab).<br/><br/>
